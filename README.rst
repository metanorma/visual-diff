====================================================

The tool will use headless Chrome to screenshot given pages
and compare resulting PNG images for differences.

Setup
-----

* ``git clone <this-repo> visual-diff && cd visual-diff``
* Obtain ``chromedriver`` binary and make sure itâ€™s in your $PATH
* Install corresponding Chrome version
* Create Python 2 environment with libraries needed::

      virtualenv diff-env
      source diff-env/bin/activate 
      pip install requirements.txt

Usage
-----

With Python environment activated, run::

    python html_diff.py <path/to/old/html/file> <path/to/new/html/file> <out_dir>
